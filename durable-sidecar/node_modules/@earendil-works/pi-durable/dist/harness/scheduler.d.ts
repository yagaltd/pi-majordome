 * Durable task scheduler of one Harness.

 * `#live` mirrors every committed non-terminal task record: pending, running, waiting, and completing. The synchronous
 * commit listener updates it on the Session line, so code running on the line reads exactly the committed state from it.
 *
 * Tasks and conversations form one ownership tree (spec §5.5): a task's parent is its owner task, or its conversation;
 * a conversation's parent is its owner task, if any. Walks up that tree decide cascades, idle scopes, and whether a
 * task's ordinary owned work is live, which holds its outcome as `completing` and delays its abort handler.
 *
 * Invariant: every task transition is decided and written by one callback serialized on the Session line. That covers
 * reservation, marks, runtime commits, finalization, and the synchronous step before each phase, which applies the
 * precedence rules and writes a fault or handover. Handlers and joins run off the line. An invocation ends inside the
 * step that decides its end, so a runtime commit it queued either lands before that decision or is rejected.
