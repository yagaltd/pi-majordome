 * handler, so the transcript keeps what the model produced and `pi.usage` counts its spend. The scheduler's commit has
 * no task scope, so that entry has no `byTaskId`. Faults come from task bugs
 * or malformed provider data (a non-JSON value in a response), or a commit the Storage rejected without effect; an
 * uncertain storage failure poisons the Session instead and writes no outcome.
